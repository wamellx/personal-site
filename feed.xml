                    I came across a job posting recently that listed in the requirements "You remember where you where when you learned INDEX-MATCH" And you know what? I DO remember where I was when I learned index-match. It was surprisingly recent, maybe a couple of months ago.

                <p>I came across a job posting recently that listed in the requirements "You remember where you where when you learned INDEX-MATCH" <br><br>And you know what? I DO remember where I was when I learned index-match. It was surprisingly recent, maybe a couple of months ago.<br><br>See, one of my most deeply held convictions has been that INDEX-MATCH is an overly complex, outdated, waste of time that's only used by people who <em>think</em> they are good at Excel but haven't yet bothered to learn XLOOKUP.<br><br>I have held this conviction for years. Getting into arguments with senior team members, friends, and my own mother. Am I out of touch? No, it is the children who are wrong.<br><br>But I was about to be defeated, I was broken by the College Football 25 Dynasty tracker from hell. <br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><br><em>For those out of the loop, INDEX-MATCH is a lookup method in Excel, it lets you feed in a search value and where to look for it, and returns an associated value. The problem with index-match is that it's complicated - it's technically two formulas that you have to nest together, and generally requires that you know the column or row number in the data you're searching.</em><br><br><em>If I'm working through a spreadsheet of customer data with 65 columns I should not have to count out which column "Address" is in.</em></p>
<p><em>XLOOKUP does a very similar thing. You tell it the search value, where to lookup the search value, and the column that the return value is in. XLOOKUP is chill because it's one function that only asks you for three things and none of them are a column number.</em><br> </p>

<figure class="post__image"><br>I started an online CFB 25 dynasty with some friends - basically we all pick college football teams, manage them year over year, and compete with each other. Because I am a sicko who makes spreadsheets for fun, I wanted to challenge myself and make the ultimate tracker for us. I had to be three things:<br><br>- Nicely formatted<br>- Easy for me to input data<br>- Able to track and display data from previous weeks, not just the current week<br><br><br><strong>Nicely formatted?</strong> Easy peasy lemon squeezy. I had a lot of fun playing with cell widths and fonts - I also stole a handy reference sheet from another CFB tracker I found with all of the logos and team info in it that I could use to pull in logos.<br><br><strong>Easy for me to input data?</strong> Ehhhhhhhh medium peazy orange juicy. <br>Rankings was pretty straightforward. Columns for week over Week, rows for the rank. I go to the rankings tab and write in the teams that ranked - 30 seconds bing bam bop.<br><br>Schedules were harder - because my brain has been rotted by years of doing crackhead calculations on sales data, I set it up so that every teams game was an individual row, even if that meant duplicating instances of games. (Georgia at Alabama in Week 12 has two entries, one for UGA and one for BAMA). I did this mostly because it made it really easy to count Wins/Losses for each team.<br><br>I used a combo of XLOOKUP + FILTER to get all of the away teams for that week, and then used that to find the home team - nice. we did it guys.<br><br>Turned this...<br><img  src="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM.png" alt="Excel table of CFB Schedules" width="2070" height="1126" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-xs.png 640w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-sm.png 768w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-md.png 1024w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-lg.png 1366w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-xl.png 1600w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.09-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><br><br>Into this...<br><br><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of spreadsheet where Home vs Away matchups are laid out correctly" width="966" height="476" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-xs.png 640w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-sm.png 768w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-md.png 1024w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-lg.png 1366w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-xl.png 1600w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.45.48-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><br><br><strong>Look at data week over week.</strong><br>This is where it gets painful. Extra stressy lemon zesty, if you will. Because I didn't use any sort of traditional data structure for my score input, I had to turn to index-match. My nemesis.<br><br>I needed our input table to fill the data into this template AND I needed it to change whenever I chose another week - so if I wanted to look at Week 5, or Week 7 - all of the data will change. <br><br><figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/HQ.gif" alt="Gif of an spreadsheet updating with CFB scores week over week" width="2610" height="1494"></figure><br><br>The listed teams and scores are all found via INDEX-MATCH, and the logos and team locations are XLOOKUPs with an INDEX-MATCH nested inside of them. I couldn't use a normal XLOOKUP here because I also have logic that adds a ranking number if the team is ranked, which would break a lookup against the reference sheet.<br><br>--<br><br>My spreadsheet is done. It's pretty. It's easy to use. <br><br>I, the hater, have been defeated. INDEX-MATCH has won.<br><br><strong>SIKEEEEEE!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>We're gearing up for Season 2 of our dynasty and so I revisited this spreadsheet to clean it up and get it ready for new data. <br><br>As I was going through it I thought "What the f*** was I thinking? Was I high when I designed this? Am I an idiot?"<br><br>I made this NEEDLESSLY complicated in round one. So for round two I redesigned the scheduling database and matchups input. One entry for each scheduled game (instead of 2), and instead of entering the scores on a separate sheet from schedule db, I can just enter them directly.<br><br>(Here's what it looks like now)<br><br><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM.png" alt="Spreadsheet table of scheduled college football games" width="1522" height="588" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-xs.png 640w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-sm.png 768w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-md.png 1024w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-lg.png 1366w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-xl.png 1600w ,https://wamellx.github.io/personal-site/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-12.46.04-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><br><br>Then I got rid of every single INDEX-MATCH on this sheet. (Ok, not reallyI still use INDEX just not MATCH and I still have to use INDEX-MATCH on the rankings table but I'm going to pretend that it sucks and that I was right all along).<br><br><br><strong>What's the moral of this story?</strong><br><br>There's a lot of possible options here:<br>- Max is always right (a classic)<br>- XLOOKUP is superior to INDEX-MATCH (duh)<br>- I desperately need new hobbies (but my fragile hands can't handle woodworking so spreadsheets it is)<br><br>But ultimately, I think the answer is "don't build bad databases" - there is a lot of energy put into the spreadsheet because I insisted on some really dumb data entry and database designs early. I just made it way harder than it needed to be.<br><br>If you wanna take a look - I've made both spreadsheets available here:<br><br>V1: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r8_dsnHsZIWvx1JyGCQHyJb4BGD5ytzDnmj_kxwNZHg/edit?usp=sharing<br>V2: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L_mzljrMStCyAyJk4amit5MtbDCtIk5QA1CBLK6fRhg/edit?usp=sharing</p>

                <p>Welcome back!! Day 2 of being fun-employed!</p>
<p>So I’m building a blog. In fact, it’s this blog! This one that you’re reading! This is my second post!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://file.notion.so/f/f/ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b/97eccffd-9f0b-45ea-a621-ffe65d5f66be/image.png?table=block&amp;id=1047bc95-f948-8019-a572-eee33f9f155d&amp;spaceId=ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b&amp;expirationTimestamp=1728511200000&amp;signature=Jyx_B7HBpoSj8kocbbKn5EGl5lue1s8tpNcVOde_a_U&amp;downloadName=image.png" alt="" width="842" height="468" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p><strong>Why? There are enough voices on the internet.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maybe someday I’d also like to be one of those voices on the internet!</li>
<li>More importantly, I’ve always wanted to be one of the professionals with their own website and a portfolio.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually this page will start to morph into a more static resume/portfolio page - but for now, it’s blog city.</p>
<p>We’re gonna be talkin’ about projects, maybe I’ll do some journaling, maybe if I can buy some new toys I’ll do a product review or something. BUT we gotta start with the actual blog.</p>
<h1>Step 1: How the hell do I get a website?</h1>
<p>This part is actually pretty easy, and if you’ve watched any YouTube video ever, you probably know what to do. There are only two steps…</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a domain</li>
<li>Figure out some a hosting provider</li>
</ol>
<p>Buying a domain is pretty easy - Google “buy a domain” and pick a provider. In the past I’ve recommended Google Domains, but they got bought by SquareSpace so I guess I recommend SquareSpace now? GoDaddy, BlueHost, NameCheap, SquareSpace all seem fine. Just pick the one that makes you feel happy.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://file.notion.so/f/f/ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b/21a58f7a-1ae4-4948-b3b4-28c110563d10/image.png?table=block&amp;id=abff10ab-bcd5-4d10-a6d1-8b9250ce48c7&amp;spaceId=ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b&amp;expirationTimestamp=1728511200000&amp;signature=QYt-k8-UQ8RJEMZMuXHNWXb_9xlQxnlh-lhGUWseyTg&amp;downloadName=image.png" alt="" width="1962" height="1632" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Look at those. I wonder what the CPQ is on these keywords…..</p>
<p>On those sites you can submit your desired name, and it will spit out a bunch of options and prices. Lucky for me, I already had <a href="http://maxwellbaum.com">maxwellbaum.com</a> so I get to skip this step!</p>
<p>Domains can range anywhere from like $12/year to $100/yr+ - really depending on which Top-Level Domain you choose (.com, .biz, .info, etc etc etc)</p>
<h1>Step 2: Picking a hosting provider</h1>
<p>A hosting provider is the company that is actually storing and serving up your website files. A domain name is like a phone number, the hosting provider is the person being called.</p>
<p>Just like a domain, there are a million different options for hosting providers - some just provide a place to put your files, others have full on web-builders.</p>
<p>For now I chose Notion but I’ll probably end up moving to something based off of WordPress eventually</p>
<h3>Notion as a CMS (Content Management System)</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I already pay for it (so basically free!)</li>
<li>Relatively simple to use (and in a past life I was a Notion Power User)</li>
<li>Quick!!! I was up and running in like 2 minutes</li>
<li>Love it for Project Management (which, I’m doin a lot of projects right now)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Where the fuck are the settings</li>
<li>Dude it so hard to keep track of all my pages and drafts.</li>
<li>Can’t really do much personalization</li>
<li>Have to pay extra to use customized domains</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically - Notion is great because you can just write and go. It’s not great because there’s literally no customization beyond that - but that’s what we like to call a “Future Max Problem”.</p>
<p>I’m a real perfectionist which keeps me from getting things done, to get around it I just have to force myself to ship as early and as often as possible. That means many many MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)</p>
<p>Notion great for an MVP - I can write and get things out of my head and just publish and share right away.</p>
<p>—</p>
<h1>V1 is here!</h1>
<p>For V1 I made sure I had two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A little snippet about me.</li>
<li>A first post.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the post I used a Notion Database and set it up in Gallery View. This allows for some level of searching and sorting, and gives each post a nice lil picture preview.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://file.notion.so/f/f/ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b/62600d43-a42c-4ad3-bf36-c97e8f391ede/image.png?table=block&amp;id=1047bc95-f948-805a-b4e7-cb22f461f377&amp;spaceId=ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b&amp;expirationTimestamp=1728511200000&amp;signature=OGo2UEpwxYdhFmOXNunifqTxiUZtjqFY5m0xHIekDII&amp;downloadName=image.png" alt="image.png" width="1578" height="744" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Notion DBs allow you to name a ton of different properties (just like you’d do an Excel file or something) - and there are some advanced features that I’ll need to dive into to see if I can use it to automate some updates or publishing.</p>
<p>But for now, I write and copy/paste into the Blog DB and then it’s live!</p>
<h1>JK! We’re on V1.1 now!!!</h1>
<p>I’ve added some extra pages - About, Experience, Blog, Projects, Contact Me</p>
<p>About → Just a lil bit about me</p>
<p>Experience → My resume with some deep dives</p>
<p>Blog → The blog database</p>
<p>Projects → A portfolio of my (soon to be) finished projects)</p>
<p>Contact Me → My email, my LinkedIn, and a Hubspot form that collects email addresses for future newsletter subscribers!</p>
<p>I think the Hubspot back-end is going to be a whole post in and of itself - all the form does is collect emails. I haven’t gotten done with the actual “email sending” part of it. But that’s for another day!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Max</p>

                <p>Hi! Welcome!</p>
<p>My name is Max - I’ve been working as a B2B (business to business) SaaS (software as a service) Sales Strategist for almost 7 years now.</p>
<p>I got laid off today - it wasn’t a huge shock, nor am I really sad to leave. Love my boss, love my team, hated just about everything else about work.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maxwellbaum.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b%2Fa6b53b4f-dfbe-49cd-a7fd-02922a7cf30c%2FIMG_5197.png?table=block&amp;id=b015244c-2bec-4486-a8fd-963f08e636f6&amp;spaceId=ce2d53ac-bc6b-4ee6-80c0-db1e1105441b&amp;width=2000&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p>I’m passionate about… consumer tech, tinkering, home projects, Excel, figuring out how to make software do cool things.</p>
<p>I’ve always been inspired by the tech journalism space. Reading articles on Engadget and Gizmodo and watching Apple keynotes are why I went to school for Industrial Design. And while that didn’t particularly work out, I’m still reading The Verge every single day. I think it might be my dream job to actually write about tech? And go to product launches, and just be in a space where people are making cool shit every single day.</p>
<p>The problem is that I have literally no journalism or writing experience - I’ve written a TON of documentation at work, but that’s where my experience ends. Soooooo - while I’m unemployed I’m going to be blogging (almost) every day. Can’t get good at writing if I don’t practice.</p>
<p>I have a massive list of projects to get done - like 13 broken computers, some smart home stuff, some dumb home stuff. I’m just gonna try to write about every single one as I do them.</p>

<p>Here is a sneak-peak of the list - see “Build a Blog” in there???</p>
<p>So I’m just gonna start writing! And see where it goes! Maybe I’ll land a job at a tech outlet! Maybe I’ll help or hurt my chances of getting employed somewhere else! Maybe I’ll just get a bunch of half-done projects finally done. And maybe I’ll find out that I just effing hate writing by next week - but for now, I’m gonna try it!</p>
<p>See ya soon!</p>
